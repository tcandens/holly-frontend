description: "Under the Art Direction of Tara Lee,  and in collaboration with the marketing department I created several series of banner ads. Wanting to try a new direction opposed to hand focused images, we searched for photos that would speak to specific types of women and the banners were tested on target demographic specific sites, such as theknot.com, match.com, pandora.com and yogajournal.com."
